"""Feature engineering utilities for the repayment risk model.

This module will provide transformation pipelines that:
- respect time-aware splits and leakage rules;
- expose composable feature builders for income cadence, cashflow, utilization, and behavior;
- serialize the fitted transformers to disk for reuse during inference.
